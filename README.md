# pyCC
This library is a decomposition strategy library under the advanced Cooperation Coevolution ÔºàCCÔºâ framework, implemented in Python to supplement the lack of Python implementations for many strategies.

We categorize some important problem decomposition strategies under the CC framework into three distinct groupsÔºöStatic Grouping, Strategies Based On Probabilistic And Statistical, and Strategies Based On Variable Interactions.

# Static Decomposition
Static decomposition involves a one-time random decomposition, with each subgroup independently optimized and then combined to form the final optimization result.

# Strategies Based On Probabilistic And Statistical
Strategies based on probabilistic and statistical aiming mitigate the issues inherent in static decomposition by capturing problem structure and variable interactions, with multiple rounds of decomposition before forming the final optimization result.
